Project 1: Tokenizer
====================
# Purpose
The tokenizer presented here takes a string of characters from the user and separates them using any space characters (" ", "\n", "\t) as borders. Then, it will print the list of separate "tokens" on the console and add it to a history. The history of tokenized strings is shown to the user each time a string is taken in. A string from history can be recalled to be retokenized by the user if need be.

# Instructions
When you see the icon ">", this means the console is seeking your input. At this point, you should type the string you want to tokenize and hit "enter" to send it to the tokenizer. Once you see the list of tokens taken from your string, you should also see the history of strings you have tokenized. If you would like to access these, type "!" then, immediately after, the number corresponding to which item you desire from the list. To wrap up and exit the program, type "!!".
